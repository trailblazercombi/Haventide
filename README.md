Haventide is a tile-based top-down 2D strategy game combining a cast of 6 characters and your own wit on (so far) a single map.

# Technologies used
The app is written in Compose Multiplatform and targets Desktop (via Java Virtual Machine) and Android.

# Artwork (slop)
The app icon, app background image and artwork for Phoenixes (= playable characters) was generated by Microsoft Copilot (back in 2023 as part of project Aetherflux).
It is a stop-gap solution sufficient for the original purpose of this project, however, I am open to replacing it with actual art made with love and care.
